### Coding Standards

This theme follows WordPress coding standards:

- **PHP:** WordPress Coding Standards (enforced via PHP CodeSniffer)
- **JavaScript:** WordPress JavaScript Coding Standards
- **CSS:** WordPress CSS Coding Standards

**Run PHP CodeSniffer to check code quality:**

```bash
# Check all PHP files
./vendor/bin/phpcs

# Check specific file
./vendor/bin/phpcs inc/Core.php

# Auto-fix fixable issues
./vendor/bin/phpcbf
```

### Creating Custom Block Patterns

Block patterns are located in the `patterns/` directory. To create a new pattern:

1. Create a new PHP file in `patterns/` (e.g., `my-pattern.php`)
2. Define the pattern metadata and HTML content
3. Register the pattern in your theme

Example pattern structure:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: My Custom Pattern
 * Slug: shadcn/my-pattern
 * Categories: featured
 */
?>
<!-- Your block markup here -->
```

### Customizing Block Styles

Block style variations are defined in `styles/blocks/` as JSON files. These files follow the WordPress `theme.json` schema for block-specific styling.

### Working with Dark Mode

The theme includes built-in dark mode support:

- JavaScript: `assets/js/dark-mode.js`
- Styles: Configured in `theme.json` color palette
- PHP: `inc/DarkMode.php`

### Testing Your Changes

1. **Test in WordPress Site Editor:**
   - Go to **Appearance → Editor**
   - Test template changes and block patterns

2. **Test responsive design:**
   - Use browser dev tools to check different screen sizes

3. **Test dark mode:**
   - Toggle system dark mode preference
   - Verify all elements render correctly

### Building for Production

When you're ready to create a distribution package:

```bash
./run.sh release
```

This will:
- Clean up development files
- Create a `release/` directory
- Generate a `shadcn.zip` file ready for distribution
- Exclude files listed in `.distignore`

### Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes following coding standards
4. Test thoroughly
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add my feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/my-feature`)
7. Create a Pull Request

### Debugging Tips

- Enable WordPress debug mode in `wp-config.php`:
  ```php
  define('WP_DEBUG', true);
  define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
  define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
  ```

- Check debug logs at: `wp-content/debug.log`
- Use browser console for JavaScript debugging
- Inspect block markup in the Site Editor
